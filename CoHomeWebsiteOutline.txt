 - After trialling similar concepts (Silicon Houseabout/Houseabout Beta, House of Nomads, and NomadHouse), CoHome was started and grown in East London since 2015. There’s been 4 CoHome’s in total, and currently there is a CoHome Brick Lane, and CoHome Hoxton.

#Home
 - Growing each other.
 - Big ideas, work together for something big
 - CoHome is an experimental CoLiving concept where people help each other grow themselves; Whether that be in interpersonal, financial, professional, experiential, spiritual, or any other type of maturity. We love hearing about each others' lives and offering up our own experince to help people grow faster.
